# Koombea React Training 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The project is set to run trough github pages at
https://edwartexe.github.io/koombea-react-training/

it should be up and running now

if you wish to run the project localy then download the project then go to pacjage.json and remove the "homepage" line as this will otherwise stop a local build from running. i learned that the hard way
